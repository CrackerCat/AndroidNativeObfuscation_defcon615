# Android Undercover
During this talk, I dive into how native code is used as an effective obfuscation technique. Implementing partial or fully-native Android application code creates challenges for reverse engineers and antiviruses. We will explore the techniques for writing native code and watch as the new app goes undetected. Then I will demonstrate how to reverse engineer and thwart an application using this obfuscation method.

## Required Software
If you want to follow along during the talk, make sure you have the following tools and code downloaded:

- [JADX](https://github.com/skylot/jadx)
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
  - Make sure the NDK is installed [Install ![Uploading Ft9HfijWwAEP6dC.jpgâ€¦]()
and configure the NDK and CMake](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/install-ndk)
